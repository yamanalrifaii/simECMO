# simECMO

 Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) serves as a life support for those suffering from
 critical pulmonary or cardiac hemodynamic dysfunction. This project, SIMECMO, is being
 developed to help those in the medical field and train them on how to use ECMO. The available
 simulations have limitations, therefore, this project will aim to include what is missing in the
 already existing simulations and be an improved version of them. We are also getting
 consultations from medical doctors and professionals to make the simulation as accurate as
 possible. We developed a prototype simulation using web technologies. This project doesnâ€™t only
 help in advancing the training techniques for ECMO, it also contributes to improvements in
 clinical outcomes. Our simulation is going to allow users to simulate various scenarios in
 ECMOtherapy.
